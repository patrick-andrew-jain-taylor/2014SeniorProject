Interference Testing (Ping test data contained in pingtext.xls)

On RPi3, the Wifi Access Point, we used default settings for configuration. This included the following:
	Channel 1
	WMM disabled
	WPA net (Test/Glasses1)
	Auth Algs = 1, MACAddr_ACL = 0 (
	IEEE 802.11b
	
With our configuration, we are looking for a sweet spot of reliability, low latency, and high bandwidth for 
video transmission. Reading through hostapd.conf.sample, we can reconfigure the access point with certain
parameters to accomplish our goal.

1) Unchanged settings

	interface=wlan0 #Wireless interface
	#bridge=br0 # No bridge necessary -- no connection to ethernet
	driver=rtl871xdrv #EDIMAX driver
	ssid=Test #Test network
	auth_algs=1 #Only Shared Key, no Open net
	
2) Changed settings

	macaddr_acl=1
	
	
		By default, this is set to 0. This denotes accept unless in deny list. We are looking to 
		implement MAC filtering, so we set macaddr_acl = 1 and uncomment accept_mac_file=/etc/hostapd.accept
		but make sure to add the MAC addresses of all 3 Pis, as well as any devices used for testing
	
	ignore_broadcast_ssid=1
	
		By default, this is set to 0. We are looking to avoid broadcasting this SSID, so this must be set 
		to 1 to send an empty SSID in beacon and ignore probe request for broadcast SSID. However, during
		testing, this will be commented out, since we want to make sure the AP is working.
		
	hw_mode=g
	
		By default, this is set to b. We want to use 802.11g (802.11b does not support WMM)
		
	wmm_enabled=1
	
		By default, this is set to 0. We are looking to improve network speed on the whole, so enabling wmm
		will allow our speeds to dramatically increase (reasons TBD)
		
	iee80211n=1
	ht_capab=[HT40+][SHORT-GI-40][DSSS_CCK-40][SHORT-GI-20][MAX-AMSDU-7935]
	
		By default, this is set to 0. The N-band will be required for speedier transmission. The ht_capab
		settings are necessary for N-band with our Edimax adapter. [NOTE: Turns out they aren't necessary,
		but are likely used to optimize network speed. Will use if running into delay issues].
